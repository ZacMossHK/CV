## About Me

I’m Zac Moss, I’m a full-stack software engineer and alumni of the Makers Academy July ‘22 cohort. I write in Javascript (including React and React Native), Python, and Ruby.

I learned to code after meeting software engineers working remote while on a rock climbing trip in Thailand. I loved the sound of a career that allowed so much flexibility! When I returned I entered lockdown and immediately started a course on Codecademy. I’ve been hooked ever since.

My earliest project! | Python, Selenium, BeautifulSoup |

## Why Hire Me?

***I love to be challenged:*** After my first online course I wanted a project that would flex my new coding skills. I wrote a script that would interact with one of my favourite websites, a database of rock climbs from around the world. It didn't have a public API so I learned how to scrape the site using Selenium to render dynamically loading pages and BeautifulSoup, a library for parsing a page's DOM, and converted the data into a leaderboard for who had completed the most climbs in an area. This proved popular with my climbing friends who are very competitive!

***Not afraid to fail:*** In my last group project at Makers we had two weeks to develop an app from scratch. We decided on a bill-splitting app for working out group meal costs in restaurants. For an added challenge, I suggested we make it a mobile app and write it in React Native - neither of which I had any experience with! This paid off when we finished with an iOS app that we could deploy through Expo.

***Calm under pressure:*** I am used to keeping it together in high-stress situations. I have worked in special effects teams on film and tv productions working with fire and water effects where mistakes could have consequences of serious injury. As a climbing photographer I would be responsible for my own safety while abseiling, hanging in mid-air on a rope while taking photos of professional climbers and athletes - sometimes only getting one attempt to get the shot!

***I’m always working on something:*** If I’m not developing my own projects (just ask me what I’m working on at the moment), you can find me [solving kata on Code Wars where I have a 3 kyu rating](https://www.codewars.com/users/ZacMoss).

#### Elements SFX (Nov ‘20 to Oct ‘21) - SFX Trainee

I worked as part of a special effects company based in SW London. As well as learning how to use many wood and metalwork tools and skills, I had the chance to work on a lot of different effects including fire and pyrotechnics, smoke and haze, and water and rain.

## Other things I enjoy outside coding

I really enjoy rock climbing and photography. I took an eight month trip through Europe and Turkey (lots of baklava), climbing some incredible and challenging routes (seeking challenge is a theme here) and taking photos of climbers ranging from amateur friends to Olympians. If you're interested you can check out photos from my adventures at https://www.zacmoss.co.uk/

I also like to solve Rubik's cubes. Over lockdown I had a goal of getting a solve in under one minute, my fastest time is 1 minute and 83 hundreths of a second. Always looking to improve!
