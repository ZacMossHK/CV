## Zac Moss

I love code! I actually have a blog to that effect - https://zaclovescode.medium.com. I'm currently studying with Makers Academy in their July '22 cohort.

I learned to code after meeting software engineers working remote while on a rock climbing trip in Thailand and became curious about what kind of career allowed them to travel and work in paradise! On return to the UK I went straight into the first UK lockdown and had way too much time on my hands. I opted to learn three skills I'd always wanted to be good at - learning to code, juggling, and solving a rubik's cube. My goals were to learn a programming language, juggle on a slackline, and solve a Rubik's cube in under a minute.

I now write in Ruby, although when I started learning coding through Codeacademy I began with Python and Javascript. I also really enjoy solving Codewars challenges and am currently at 4kta. As for the other skills, I can walk and juggle on a slackline at the same time, and solve a Rubik's cube in 1 minute and 83 hundreths of a second!

Before starting with Makers I had been working in the film and TV industry since 2014, starting as a runner and assistant director and then moving into special effects since 2019. My first ever job in film was on an Egyptian hamburger commercial and our day lasted 19 hours! After many more long days and late nights I'm now looking for a fresh start in a new industry.

Other things I love include rock climbing and photography. I have climbed around the world, as well as the UK and Thailand I have spent climbing in Turkey (Baklava ❤️) , Spain, France, and Greece (my favourite, and also the best food!) I have climbed sport routes up to 7b and debatably bouldered between 6C and 7A+ depending on who you ask.

I have also taken photos in most of those countries mentioned above of both amateur and professional climbers, and enjoy hanging on a rope taking photos almost as much as climbing itself! You can see some of my photography at https://zacmoss.co.uk.

## Work Experience

**Elements SFX** (Nov 2020 to Oct 2021)  
SFX Trainee

A continuous stint with a special effects company based in SW London. As well as learning how to use many wood and metalwork tools and skills, I had the chance to work on a lot of different effects including fire and pyrotechnics, smoke and haze, and water and rain. Some effects I was involved with included:

-emulating a river overflowing in a storm by dropping two tons of water on a caravan down a slide made of plywood and scaffolding,
-setting things on fire like a whole kitchen, a boxing ring, and a moped,
-covering a popular Hackney street in snow,
-smoking out a forest near Guildford before having to stop due to torrential hailstorm in April (that bit wasn't us),
-running a bath (actually an effect).

I am also a coded welder and have a current forklift ticket.
