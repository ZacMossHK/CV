## Zac Moss

I’m Zac Moss, I’m a full-stack software engineer and alumni of the Makers Academy July ‘22 cohort. I write in Javascript (including React and React Native) and Ruby.

I learned to code after meeting software engineers working remote while on a rock climbing trip in Thailand. I loved a career that allowed you to travel and work! When I returned I entered lockdown and immediately started a course in Python on Codecademy. I was hooked.

Hungry for coding challenges after tearing through kata on Code Wars (I now have a 4 kta rating!), I gave myself one of my first projects: writing a script that would work with the website of one of the biggest rock climbing databases in the world. It didn't have a public API so my Python script scraped the site using Selenium to render dynamically loading pages and BeautifulSoup, a library for parsing a page's DOM, and converted the data into a leaderboard for who had completed the most climbs in an area. This proved popular with my climbing friends who are very competitive!

I continued to test myself during my time in the Makers Academy bootcamp. In my last group project at Makers we had two weeks to develop an app from scratch. We decided on a bill-splitting app for working out group meal costs in restaurants. For an added challenge, I suggested we make it a mobile app and write it in React Native - neither of which we had any experience with! This paid off when on completion we had an iOS app that we could deploy to mobile devices through Expo. I learned that there are few things as saying as seeing your app working in the palm of your hand.


Other things I enjoy outside coding: I'm a keen climber (as mentioned) and photographer. I recently came back from an eight month climbing and photography trip through Europe and Turkey (lots of baklava), climbing some incredible and challenging routes (seeking challenge is a theme here) and taking photos of climbers ranging from amateur friends to Olympians. If you're interested you can check out photos from my adventures at https://www.zacmoss.co.uk/

I also like to solve Rubik's cubes. Over lockdown I had a goal of getting a solve in under one minute, my fastest time is 1 minute and 83 hundreths of a second. Always looking to improve!

## Work Experience

**Elements SFX** (Nov 2020 to Oct 2021)  
SFX Trainee

A continuous stint with a special effects company based in SW London. As well as learning how to use many wood and metalwork tools and skills, I had the chance to work on a lot of different effects including fire and pyrotechnics, smoke and haze, and water and rain. Some effects I was involved with included:

-emulating a river overflowing in a storm by dropping two tons of water on a caravan down a slide made of plywood and scaffolding,
-setting things on fire like a whole kitchen, a boxing ring, and a moped,
-covering a popular Hackney street in snow,
-smoking out a forest near Guildford before having to stop due to torrential hailstorm in April (that bit wasn't us),
-running a bath (actually an effect).

I am also a coded welder and have a current forklift ticket.

**Company Name** (start-date to end-date)  
_Your job title_

- Any experience relevent to software development

## Skills

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider your best skills. Pick 2-4 skills and write a short descriptive paragraph for each one. You should demonstrate how capable you are at this skill with examples.
(Using a STAR example Paragraph) Consider the questions below.

-STAR
-What was the situation/task? (ST)

-How was the skill used?

-What did you do? (action)

-What was the result?


#### This Skill

- Experience
- Achievements
- Evidence (STAR)

#### Another Skill

Descriptive paragraph of how capable you are at this skill and, if relevant, how it has developed (again use STAR for this)

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)

## Education

#### Makers Academy (start_date to end_date)
- Use short descriptions of what you did and a skill you used. (Similar to format from the 'Work Experience' section above)
- e.g Frequently used paring in order to problemsolve effeciently, requiring teamwork and communication.
- you might also mention aspects some other skills/knowledge listed below: 
- OOP, TDD, MVC, DDD
- Agile/XP
- Ruby, Rails, JavaScript
- RSpec, Jasmine

#### Your University / College (start_date to end_date)

- Subject, any specialisms
- Grade
- Other cool stuff
